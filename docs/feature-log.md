## v0.5.5 - 2026-03-22

Ingestion deduplication added.

Added:

- exact duplicate knowledge-base uploads are deduplicated by normalized content hash plus embedding profile
- duplicate uploads skip chunking, embedding, and vector upsert work

Behavior:

- the same content can still be ingested separately under a different embedding profile
- duplicate uploads return a successful ingest result marked as deduplicated

Added:

- `nim` provider alias for generation and embeddings
- NIM API key env wiring
- NIM embedding profile example for `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2`

## v0.5.9 - 2026-03-25

Chat persona wording refined for a more professional and engaging tone.

Changed:

- assistant prompt now targets a polished, customer-facing voice
- fallback wording is more natural and less technical when context is missing
- prompt instructions now discourage overly expressive responses while keeping the assistant warm and approachable
- prompt-builder tests and user-facing docs were updated to match the new tone

## v0.5.10 - 2026-03-25

Editable system prompt support added.

Added:

- PostgreSQL-backed storage for the active system prompt
- admin-only `GET /admin/system-prompt`
- admin-only `PUT /admin/system-prompt`
- chat requests now load the stored system prompt on each run

Changed:

- the hardcoded prompt string was moved out of the chat builder and into the prompt store

## v0.5.11 - 2026-03-26

Generation controls and thinking visibility toggles added.

Added:

- shared `.env` generation settings for:
  - `CHAT_TEMPERATURE`
  - `CHAT_TOP_P`
  - `CHAT_FREQUENCY_PENALTY`
  - `CHAT_PRESENCE_PENALTY`
  - `CHAT_MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS`
- provider wiring for OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and NVIDIA NIM to read the shared generation settings
- `CHAT_THINKING_ENABLED` as the single thinking switch across supported providers
- `CHAT_SHOW_THINKING_BLOCK` to show or hide the visible `<thinking>` block in chat output
- chat response shaping so thinking can be surfaced separately without forcing it into the final answer text

Changed:

- provider output normalization now strips or preserves `<think>` and `<thinking>` blocks based on the single thinking toggle
- the chat service now formats completion text consistently before truncation and session storage
- runbook and `.env.example` now document the new generation and thinking controls

## v0.5.12 - 2026-03-26

NIM URL sync moved into an explicit helper script.

Changed:

- `NIM_BASE_URL` is now written into `backend/.env` by `scripts/sync-provider-urls.ps1`
- `RERANK_INVOKE_URL` is now written into `backend/.env` by `scripts/sync-provider-urls.ps1`
- the sync script concatenates the rerank model into the NVIDIA rerank URL so the path stays aligned with `RERANK_MODEL`
- runtime config now reads the explicit URL values from `.env` instead of deriving them in the settings model

Behavior:

- local developers can refresh the generated URL values with one script instead of editing multiple files
- the app continues to use the same NIM and rerank endpoints at runtime after `.env` is rewritten

## v0.5.13 - 2026-03-26

Admin inspection and reingest controls added.

Added:

- admin-only document inspection endpoints for listing ingested documents and viewing a document as reconstructed text or raw chunks
- `force_reingest` support for `POST /ingest/files` and `POST /ingest/text`
- smoke-test helper script for login, ingest, and chat verification against the live API

Changed:

- duplicate document uploads can now be replaced intentionally instead of always being deduplicated
- document inspection responses expose chunk-level metadata for debugging retrieval quality
- the smoke test can print debug chunk payloads for both `/chat` and `/chat/stream`

## v0.5.14 - 2026-03-26

Retrieval, parser, and prompt cleanup hardening added.

Fixed:

- DOCX parsing now retains heading-only sections so important collaboration steps are not dropped during ingestion
- NIM stream parsing now skips empty non-content events instead of raising `IndexError`
- completion handling now tolerates `None` content values in provider responses
- the assistant prompt now uses a single canonical source instead of being duplicated in SQL seed data
- terminal decorative emoji are discouraged at the prompt level and scrubbed as a fallback

Changed:

- `/chat` and `/chat/stream` now share the same prepared retrieval context more consistently
- chat output truncation prefers cleaner sentence endings instead of abrupt cuts
- the smoke test script now exercises the same ingestion and retrieval path used by the API

## v0.5.15 - 2026-03-26

Added:

- `GET /admin/model-catalog` for listing the selectable generation and embedding profiles

- `PUT /admin/model-selection` for switching the active generation and embedding profiles

Changed:

- chat defaults now resolve through the DB-backed model-selection record
- docs now treat the profile catalog as the selectable list, while the active selection is managed by admin

## v0.5.16 - 2026-03-29

Added:

- PostgreSQL-backed `chat_activity_logs` table for chat usage auditing
- request capture for authenticated chat traffic including:
  - user id and username

  - client IP and forwarded IP chain
  - user agent
  - session id
  - user prompt
  - final answer
  - provider and model metadata
  - fallback and failure status
- admin-only `GET /admin/chat-activity`

Changed:

- admin chat activity lookup now uses query params instead of record ID lookup
- `GET /admin/chat-activity` now returns an `overview` block plus filtered `activities`
- activity filters support `start_at`, `end_at`, `keyword`, and `limit`
- `start_at` and `end_at` accept `DD/MM/YYYY` as well as ISO 8601 timestamps

Fixed:

- activity logging failures no longer break `/chat` or `/chat/stream`
- startup now creates auth tables before creating audit tables on older volumes
- chat activity response mapping fixed for Pydantic model-to-model validation
- Docker smoke check confirmed `GET /admin/chat-activity` works both with no date filter and with `DD/MM/YYYY` dates
