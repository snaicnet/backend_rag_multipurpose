Behavior:

- blocked chat requests return clear validation errors
- streaming responses are capped before the client receives them
- chat history is trimmed before prompt construction

## v0.5.5 - 2026-03-22

Ingestion deduplication added.

Added:

- exact duplicate knowledge-base uploads are deduplicated by normalized content hash plus embedding profile
- duplicate uploads skip chunking, embedding, and vector upsert work

Behavior:

- the same content can still be ingested separately under a different embedding profile
- duplicate uploads return a successful ingest result marked as deduplicated

## v0.5.6 - 2026-03-25

NVIDIA NIM support added as an explicit provider alias.

Added:

- `nim` provider alias for generation and embeddings
- NIM API key env wiring
- NIM embedding profile example for `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2`
- reranking path derived from `RERANK_MODEL`
- reranker reuses `NIM_API_KEY`

Changed:

- OpenAI provider remains fixed to the public OpenAI endpoint internally
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` was removed from the env surface
- NIM embedding requests now send `input_type=query|passage` and `truncate=NONE`

## v0.5.7 - 2026-03-25

Reasoning-off controls and ingest compatibility fixes added.

Added:

- NIM reasoning control now follows the provider-specific chat thinking flag
- greedy decoding defaults for NIM chat when reasoning is disabled

Fixed:

- ECS now uses `NIM_API_KEY` for generation, embeddings, and reranking
- ECS docs now describe the NIM-based deployment path

## v0.5.9 - 2026-03-25

Chat persona wording refined for a more professional and engaging tone.

Changed:

- assistant prompt now targets a polished, customer-facing voice
- fallback wording is more natural and less technical when context is missing
- prompt instructions now discourage overly expressive responses while keeping the assistant warm and approachable
- prompt-builder tests and user-facing docs were updated to match the new tone

## v0.5.10 - 2026-03-25

Editable system prompt support added.

Added:

- PostgreSQL-backed storage for the active system prompt
- admin-only `GET /admin/system-prompt`
- admin-only `PUT /admin/system-prompt`
- chat requests now load the stored system prompt on each run

Changed:

- the hardcoded prompt string was moved out of the chat builder and into the prompt store
- startup seeds a default prompt if none exists yet

## v0.5.11 - 2026-03-26

Generation controls and thinking visibility toggles added.

Added:

- shared `.env` generation settings for:
  - `CHAT_TEMPERATURE`
  - `CHAT_TOP_P`
  - `CHAT_FREQUENCY_PENALTY`
  - `CHAT_PRESENCE_PENALTY`
  - `CHAT_MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS`
- provider wiring for OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and NVIDIA NIM to read the shared generation settings
- `CHAT_THINKING_ENABLED` as the single thinking switch across supported providers
- `CHAT_SHOW_THINKING_BLOCK` to show or hide the visible `<thinking>` block in chat output
- chat response shaping so thinking can be surfaced separately without forcing it into the final answer text

Changed:

- provider output normalization now strips or preserves `<think>` and `<thinking>` blocks based on the single thinking toggle
- the chat service now formats completion text consistently before truncation and session storage
- runbook and `.env.example` now document the new generation and thinking controls

## v0.5.12 - 2026-03-26

NIM URL sync moved into an explicit helper script.

Changed:

- `NIM_BASE_URL` is now written into `backend/.env` by `scripts/sync-provider-urls.ps1`
- `RERANK_INVOKE_URL` is now written into `backend/.env` by `scripts/sync-provider-urls.ps1`
- the sync script concatenates the rerank model into the NVIDIA rerank URL so the path stays aligned with `RERANK_MODEL`
- runtime config now reads the explicit URL values from `.env` instead of deriving them in the settings model

Behavior:

- local developers can refresh the generated URL values with one script instead of editing multiple files
- the app continues to use the same NIM and rerank endpoints at runtime after `.env` is rewritten

## v0.5.13 - 2026-03-26

Admin inspection and reingest controls added.

Added:

- admin-only document inspection endpoints for listing ingested documents and viewing a document as reconstructed text or raw chunks
- `force_reingest` support for `POST /ingest/files` and `POST /ingest/text`
- smoke-test helper script for login, ingest, and chat verification against the live API

Changed:

- duplicate document uploads can now be replaced intentionally instead of always being deduplicated
- document inspection responses expose chunk-level metadata for debugging retrieval quality
- the smoke test can print debug chunk payloads for both `/chat` and `/chat/stream`

## v0.5.14 - 2026-03-26

Retrieval, parser, and prompt cleanup hardening added.

Fixed:

- DOCX parsing now retains heading-only sections so important collaboration steps are not dropped during ingestion
- NIM stream parsing now skips empty non-content events instead of raising `IndexError`
- completion handling now tolerates `None` content values in provider responses
- the assistant prompt now uses a single canonical source instead of being duplicated in SQL seed data
- terminal decorative emoji are discouraged at the prompt level and scrubbed as a fallback

Changed:

- `/chat` and `/chat/stream` now share the same prepared retrieval context more consistently
- chat output truncation prefers cleaner sentence endings instead of abrupt cuts
- the smoke test script now exercises the same ingestion and retrieval path used by the API

## v0.5.15 - 2026-03-26

Admin-managed generation and embedding selection added.

Added:

- `GET /admin/model-catalog` for listing the selectable generation and embedding profiles
- `GET /admin/model-selection` for viewing the active profiles
- `PUT /admin/model-selection` for switching the active generation and embedding profiles

Changed:

- chat defaults now resolve through the DB-backed model-selection record
- docs now treat the profile catalog as the selectable list, while the active selection is managed by admin

## v0.5.16 - 2026-03-29

Chat activity monitoring and admin audit search added.

Added:

- PostgreSQL-backed `chat_activity_logs` table for chat usage auditing
- request capture for authenticated chat traffic including:
  - user id and username
  - auth type
  - client IP and forwarded IP chain
  - user agent
  - session id
  - user prompt
  - final answer
  - provider and model metadata
  - fallback and failure status
- admin-only `GET /admin/chat-activity`

Changed:

- admin chat activity lookup now uses query params instead of record ID lookup
- `GET /admin/chat-activity` now returns an `overview` block plus filtered `activities`
- activity filters support `start_at`, `end_at`, `keyword`, and `limit`
- `start_at` and `end_at` accept `DD/MM/YYYY` as well as ISO 8601 timestamps

Fixed:

- activity logging failures no longer break `/chat` or `/chat/stream`
- startup now creates auth tables before creating audit tables on older volumes
- chat activity response mapping fixed for Pydantic model-to-model validation
- Docker smoke check confirmed `GET /admin/chat-activity` works both with no date filter and with `DD/MM/YYYY` dates

## v0.5.17 - 2026-03-29

Chat feedback capture and session-aware response shaping added.

Added:

- authenticated `POST /chat/feedback`
- admin-only `GET /admin/chat-feedback`
- PostgreSQL-backed `chat_feedback` table for session feedback capture
- feedback records now include:
  - session id
  - rating from `1..5`
  - optional comment
  - feedback date
  - reconstructed full chat text for the rated session

Changed:

- `/chat` now echoes `session_id` in the response when the client sends one
- `/chat/stream` now includes `session_id` in SSE metadata and done events when the client sends one
- feedback list supports optional `start_at` and `end_at` filters
- feedback date filters accept `DD/MM/YYYY` and ISO 8601 timestamps

Verified:

- focused tests passed for chat activity, chat feedback, chat stream, and chat response coverage

## v0.5.18 - 2026-04-02

Multi-query and source-diversity retrieval added.

Added:

- heuristic query planning for multi-clause questions before retrieval
- retrieval fan-out across multiple query variants for the same user request
- source-diversity-aware final chunk selection so one document is less likely to crowd out all top slots
- regression tests for multi-query retrieval and reranker tail preservation

Changed:

- lexical retrieval is now allowed to contribute candidates even when semantic retrieval returns some results
- reranker handling now preserves unranked candidates instead of silently truncating the tail
- retrieval cache keys now include the active retrieval-strategy version

Result:

- the backend is no longer limited to single-query retrieval over a mixed corpus
- it is still heuristic multi-source retrieval, not a full planner-based multi-hop system

## v0.5.19 - 2026-04-02

Generation-side evidence narrowing and binary adjudication prompting added.

Added:

- binary-question-specific generation chunk selection in `PromptBuilder`
- question-anchored document scoring for generation context selection
- explicit binary decision guidance in the generated user prompt for yes/no questions

Changed:

- `ChatService` now keeps the full retrieved chunk set for debug output, but can pass a smaller evidence subset into generation
- binary and comparison-style questions now prioritize a smaller document set for final answer generation instead of the full retrieved bundle

Result:

- retrieval breadth is preserved for observability
- final answer generation now favors precision over raw context volume on yes/no and multi-clause questions

## v0.5.20 - 2026-04-02

Binary adjudication pre-pass added for yes/no questions.

Added:

- internal JSON-based binary adjudication prompt for yes/no questions
- binary answer parser for strict `Yes` or `No` extraction
- precomputed yes/no answer path that works for both `/chat` and `/chat/stream`

Changed:

- binary questions can now be answered from a dedicated adjudication pass before the normal answer prompt is used
- if the adjudicator cannot produce a clean `Yes` or `No`, the backend falls back to the normal generation path

Result:

- binary-heavy benchmarks can now separate decision quality from normal answer-style drift
- the backend keeps the standard prompt path as a fallback instead of forcing the adjudication result when it is ambiguous

## v0.5.21 - 2026-04-02

Anchor-aware binary evidence selection and relation guidance added.

Added:

- source-anchor-aware generation document selection for binary questions
- date-anchor-aware generation document selection for binary questions
- relation guidance for conjunction, change/difference, and consistency questions in the adjudication prompt

Changed:

- binary question generation now prefers only the matched source/date documents when anchors are clear
- binary adjudication prompts now explain what `Yes` means for change, difference, and consistency questions

Result:

- the adjudication path now sees less same-source noise
- comparison-style yes/no questions have more explicit semantics for final decision making

## v0.5.22 - 2026-04-02

Built-in system prompt sync and prompt-quality improvements added.

Changed:

- the default SNAIC system prompt now includes the proven binary and comparison rules from the eval cycle
- startup now auto-upgrades the stored system prompt when the current database prompt still matches a known built-in prompt variant
- startup also replaces the temporary eval benchmark prompt if it was accidentally left as the live backend prompt

Preserved:

- custom admin-managed prompts are not overwritten on startup

Result:

- prompt improvements are now reflected in the actual backend system after restart, not only in eval-specific paths
- existing environments migrate safely to the improved built-in SNAIC prompt without clobbering intentional custom prompts

## v0.5.23 - 2026-04-09

NIM prompt handling and generation context shaping simplified.

Changed:

- NIM chat requests no longer prepend a synthetic system message ahead of the real stored system prompt
- chat flow now always uses the normal grounded generation path and no longer runs the binary adjudication pre-pass
- prompt building no longer injects binary-only decision scaffolding for yes/no questions
- generation now uses the retrieved chunk set directly instead of a binary-specific subset selector
- prompt excerpts now use the configured `max_chunk_chars` budget instead of an internal hard `700` character cap
- default `chat_max_input_tokens` increased to `4000`

Fixed:

- late evidence inside a retrieved chunk now remains visible to the model when the configured chunk budget allows it
- debug smoke helpers now print `retrieved_chunks` by default so retrieval-vs-prompt issues are easier to inspect

Result:

- the model now sees more of the actual retrieved evidence for answer generation
- yes/no answers now come from the normal model output path instead of a separate adjudication shortcut
- NIM follows the intended stored system prompt more reliably

Updated later:

- indirect grounded questions are now classified as supported when the answer follows from directly combining closely related listed facts
- the default SNAIC prompt now treats combinations such as `technology + supported sector` as sufficient support for a conservative answer
- local query debugging now prints the live stored system prompt so prompt-vs-runtime mismatches are easier to confirm

Updated again:

- prompt assembly now uses a simpler message layout:
  - one `system` message for the stored system prompt
  - one optional combined `assistant` message for rolling conversation history
  - one `user` message for the current question
  - one `user` message for retrieved context
- `PromptContext` no longer stores a duplicate `system_prompt` field because the system prompt already exists inside `messages`
- `PromptContext` now carries `retrieved_chunks` directly alongside `messages` and `citations`
- prompt builder cleanup removed unused managed-prompt hash tracking and unused lexical helper constants
- local runtime now has `CHAT_THINKING_ENABLED=true` in `backend/.env` so NIM reasoning mode is enabled through the existing provider path

Result:

- prompt payloads are easier to inspect and reason about during debugging
- conversation history is now passed as one labeled assistant message instead of multiple mixed-role entries
- prompt-related state is simpler and less redundant

Updated again:

- prompt context selection within each document now prefers the highest-similarity chunks instead of the earliest chunk order
- prompt context now omits non-answering metadata noise such as publisher, published-at, URL, excerpt counts, and similarity labels
- `CHAT_MAX_EXCERPTS_PER_DOCUMENT` was added as a runtime config so per-document prompt evidence can be tuned without editing code
- `/chat` and `/chat/stream` now honor a server-side `CHAT_DEBUG_ENABLED` switch before returning debug payloads such as `retrieved_chunks` and `prompt_messages`

Result:

- prompt evidence shown to the model now more reliably includes the decisive retrieved span for same-document questions such as partner-organisation lookups
- debug visibility can now be disabled globally even when a client sends `debug=true`

## Current feature set - 2026-03-29

## Notes

- Version labels in this log are internal project markers, not published package tags.
- TLS termination is still expected to be handled by deployment infrastructure rather than by the FastAPI app itself.
